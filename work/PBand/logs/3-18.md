# Questions
- SNR Value used inside cfg isn't used in plot - might re run it, ask before I overwrite data
- Distortion test results not necessary?

# Some issues
- IPN RXA(2) last three frequencies missing
- Gain flatness RXA/B(2) missing
- SNR RXB(2) - 
- Scaling on TXA/B snr ---- Need to re run or refactor tx test with new config values (plot is generated during test and requires outputs from tx test)
- Attenuation RXA/B(1/2) scaling y axis -45  - Re run atten rx test (line 270 of atten_rx.py)

## Missing 3 points on IPN (XCVR0, Channel 2 RXA-2)
