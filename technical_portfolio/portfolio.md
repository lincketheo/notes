# Key
For each service, library, tool time stamp a date and how well you feel with the technology.
Optionally add notes
For example:
```
- C++ - 01/2025:80%
        - I feel really confident on pointers and smart ptrs
      - 06/2025:50%
        - I remember knowing smart pointers well but I forgot how to use them
```

Note for future, might want to sort by relevant and irrelevant and want to learn.

# Understanding Scale (0%-100%)

- 0%:   Do I have no idea how to start anything with this technology?
- 10%:  Hello World. Have I barely touched it—maybe installed it once—but I still rely on step-by-step guides?
- 20%:  Do I get the broad idea but lack the confidence to troubleshoot anything on my own?
- 30%:  Could I follow a standard recipe for setup but freeze if something unexpected happens?
- 40%:  Have I completed a toy project but still needed lots of hand-holding?
- 50%:  Do I know the basics well enough to build something simple, yet consult docs frequently?
- 60%:  Have I used it in at least one real project with moderate independence, but still stumble on advanced features?
- 70%:  Could I troubleshoot common errors, explain its integration points, and run it smoothly day to day?
- 80%:  Do I rarely need documentation for typical tasks, and can adapt it to unique use cases?
- 90%:  Could I onboard others, handle complex scenarios, and optimize performance without much outside help?
- 100%: Am I able to teach advanced classes, find creative ways to break rules, and predict its future directions?
