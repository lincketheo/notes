# Key
For each service, library, tool time stamp a date and how well you feel with the technology.
Optionally add notes
For example:
```
- C++ - 01/2025:80%
        - I feel really confident on pointers and smart ptrs
      - 06/2025:50%
        - I remember knowing smart pointers well but I forgot how to use them
```

Note for future, might want to sort by relevant and irrelevant and want to learn.

# Understanding Scale (0%-100%)

- 0%:   I can't start anything without reading the docs.
- 10%:  I could write a hello world and don't have a good feeling about it.
- 20%:  I could write a hello world and have a good feeling about it.
- 30%:  I could follow a standard recipe (with help from docs) but couldn't break out of that wireframe. 
- 40%:  I could follow a standard recipe (with help from the docs) and I'm starting to see how I could break out of the wireframe.
- 50%:  I could build something simple without the help of a tutorial or wireframe (but help from the docs).
- 60%:  I've used this on at least one large scale project but I wouldn't be productive.
- 70%:  I could be productive as long as I have access to docs.
- 80%:  I could be productive and only need docs when I use it differently than normal.
- 90%:  I could onboard others, handle complex scenarios, and optimize performance without much outside help.
- 100%: I am able to teach advanced classes, find creative ways to break rules, and predict its future directions.
