# IN

## Description:
Quick things that need to be done - no processing. This "In" list can be in multiple places. Also in your notebook.

## Processing:
- Process one by one _in order_
- Is it actionable?
    - No: Someday / Maybe or throw it away
    - Yes: Physical and visible action
        - Bad: "plan cake lottery"
        - Good: "Email the guys about what cakes they want"
- If it takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it

***
- Budget
- Write a javascript library for compute substring (similar to what you did in wicked hornet)
