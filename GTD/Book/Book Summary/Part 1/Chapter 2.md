Five Steps
1. Capture what has our attention
	- Tools:
		- Physical in tray
		- Paper based note taking devices
		- Email
	- Three requirements:
		- Every open loop must be in your capture system and out of your head 
		- You must have as few capturing buckets as you can get by with 
		- You must empty them regularly
2. Clarify what each item means and what to do about it 
	- What is it?
	- Is it actionable?
	- Three **Non Actionable** options:
		- Trash
		- Incubate
		- Reference
	- Two **Actionable** options:
		- What project or outcome have you committed to?
		- What is the next action required?
			- Three options for actionable items:
				- Do it
				- Delegate it
				- Defer it
			- If < 2 minutes, do it
			- Else, am I the right person to do this? No? Delegate it
			- Longer than 2 minutes - defer and put on next actions
3. Organize the results

		- Trash
		- Incubation
		- Reference
	- Actionable Items
