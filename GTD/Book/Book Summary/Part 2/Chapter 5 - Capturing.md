Practical reasons to gather everything before clarifying
1. Helpful to have a sense of the volume of stuff you have to deal with
2. Lets you know where the end of the tunnel is
3. When you are clarifying and organizing, you won't be distracted by amorphous mass of stuff that might still be somewhere

Steps to capturing
1. Physical gathering: Search env for things that don't permanently belong where they are
2. Mental space: What has your attention that isn't represented by something already in the in tray
