This is my root planning and organization system for my _life_ tasks. The context of this readme is only relevant to life as I must keep work and life separate due to national security.

## North Star:
A sentence or two so that you don't have to remember all the notes in a system. A TLDR of sorts, but specific to you. Still trying to figure out a way to organize this into my notes. For now, I'll just write North Star: throughout my docs

## Change Contract
North Star: Any time I change the nature of my system, update this file.

## Log's Concept
Logs are a way to spitball my sessions/life. They are meant to be _highly unorganized thoughts and bullet points_ as a way to track what I did in a day. Things to put in logs:
- Quick description of what things I've done in a day (there is _no_ requirement to write everything or detailed notes - or else this would defeat the purpose of making it easy)
- Unorganized thoughts - stream of ideas that I can parse through _if I want_ later on
Generally, these notes aren't meant to change, but (unless the system changes) it's ok if I find a scenario to change them. I trust myself

North Star:
Good: Write _anything_ in the logs
Better: Write detailed descriptions in logs - keep track of day to day life and detail structured notes
Best: Time stamp each task I did - classify what categories each log fits under (In terms of this readme)

## Directories:
1. Notes
	- This folder is for deliberate notes that are orthogonal to my life. E.g. information that has nothing to do with planning my life, current projects etc.
2. Planning
	- This folder is all about productivity in my life. Planning and keeping on top of my life

### Notes
1. Classes
	- Have I signed up for a class or tutorial? If so, that's where those notes go
2. Solutions
	- Mostly code, sometimes other things like how to fix settings etc. This is a reference area. I can check to see if I've done work before to solve something and come back to it.
	- Think of this as "stack overflow answers that I don't want to google again"
	 - Examples include: 
		 - `C` code for how to read and print a file as bytes.
		 - How to recursively update git submodules
	- Try to make these documents short - keep any implementation details out inside `Topics`
1. Topics
	- More detailed notes about topics that come up. Extra information to Solutions, short notes about various topics I learn about throughout the day.

### Planning
1. GTD 
	- I'm currently trying out the GTD workflow. Keep this folder relevant only to life.
	 - I think this is likely to change in the future. Examples:
		 - Planning/Projects might replace the Projects file
		 - In shouldn't replace logs I don't think because they serve two distinct purposes. My in file might just be smaller but I can move things from logs to in or logs to next actions
1. Life Planning
	- These are goals, budgeting, routines etc. Work in progress, but mostly just ways of managing my life
2. Logs
	- See Log's Concept
	- These logs are for life only. Not work.
3. Personal Projects
	- Specific tasks for specific personal projects I have.
