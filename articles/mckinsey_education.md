## Build Durable Coalition for Change
1. Set fewer priorities to get more done.
    - Define a north star
    - No more than 3-6 priorities
    - Case Study:
        - Mississippi
            - Each meeting they recap those goals
        - Kenya 
            - 2010-2014: There wer 15 different interventions for literacy
            - 2014: 1 evidence based approach (Tuesome)
                - Doubled # of students who hit literacy benchmarks from 2014 - 2020
2. Cultivate Leadership beyond a single leader 
    - Political leaders change rapidly and initiatives should be planned for 10's of years
    - 1 leader can't drive for that long 
    - Provide training resources development for the old timer civil servants
        - The people who've been around forever
    - Case Study:
        - Norway
            - Norweigian ministry of education
3. Engage educators and families authentically
    - Engaged advisory boards
    - Conduct parent, student, teacher surveys
    - Executive cabinet should visit "front lines" at least 2x per month
    - Case Study:
        - Kaya Henderson
            - Less pushback during closures
        - Cecilia Maria Velez White
            - Monthly meetings with principals
            - Listening tour every 2 weeks 

## Create Delivery Capacity to Scale
4. Create Coordination and cadence for change 
    - Fast plans -> action 
    - Show quick wins within the first 6 months
    - Case Study:
        - London Challenge initiatives 
            - London appointed advisors to the most struggling schools 
5. Build implementation structures and skills
    - Strong internal structures and good staff
    - Case Study:
        - Jaime Saavedra Peru
            - Experienced managers from inside and out government
            - Better principals
        - Ceara Brazil
            - 150 highest performing schools adopt 150 lowest performing schools 

## Drive and Adapt with Data
6. Measure student outcomes and make them transparent
    - Robust data systems
    - Case study:
        - Estonia 
            - student outcome linked with social data 
            - One central data system for all public services (unique id for each citizen)
                - Requires trust and transparency to the public
        - Sierra Leone 
            - Built data systems from the ground up
            - Digitize school census
            - Data wrt gender inequity -> resulted in more girl enrollement
7. Roll out what works - create space for innovation
    - Structured pedagogy
    - Case study:
        - Malawi
            - Offline / solar powered tablets
