1. Don't take yourself seriously and embrace embarassement _in the right circumstances but demand respect in others_ 
    - When it's ok to do so, embarass yourself
        - e.g. Karaeoke - it is perfectly fine to embarass yourself
2. Dress up for work and play the game only during business hours
3. Software Engineering - Learn how to simplify things - picture yourself in the future being stupid 
4. Tune out everything that you don't think pertains to you at the moment  - focus
5. Always be uncomfortable until it's your turn to lead / perform??
