# Delay tolerant Networking

- Address issues 
    - in heterogeneous networks 
    - No continuous network connectivity
    - Example:  
        - Mobile / extreme terrestrial 

- Solutions
    - Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET)
    - Vehicular ad hoc networking

- Interesting notes:
    - DARPA supports it - funds lots of projects 
        - NASA 
        - MITRE 
            - Interplanetary internet (IPN)
            - Vint Cerf - designing networks for space 
                - Coined DTN term
