| **economics**                | the study of how individuals and societies choose to allocate scarce resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **scarcity**                 | the fact that there is a limited amount of resources to satisfy unlimited wants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **economic resources**       | also called the **factors of production**; these are the land (natural resources such as minerals and oil), labor (work contributed by humans), capital (tools, equipment, and facilities), and entrepreneurship (the capacity to organize, develop, and manage a business) that individuals and businesses use in the production of goods and services. |
| **models**                   | graphical and mathematical tools created by economists to better understand complicated processes in economics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **positive analysis**        | analytical thinking about objective facts and cause-and-effect relationships that are testable, such as how much of a good will be sold when a price changes.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **normative analysis**       | unlike positive analysis, normative analysis is subjective thinking about what we should value or a course of action that should be taken, such as the importance of environmental factors and the approach to managing them.                                                                                                                            |

| **macroeconomics**           | the study of aggregates and the overall commercial output and health of nations; includes the analysis of factors such as unemployment, inflation, economic growth and interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **economic aggregates**      | measures such as the unemployment rate, rate of inflation, and national output that summarize all markets in an economy, rather than individual markets; economic aggregates are frequently used as measures of the economic performance of an economy.                                                                                                  |

## Discussion questions
- Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle once called economics the "dismal science" because he believed it obsessively focused on the scarcity of resources. What does the field of economics provide society that other sciences such as chemistry, biology and physics cannot?

- Using at least three key terms from this lesson, explain how scarcity affects you in your everyday life.
    
- What are the three basic economic questions? How have different societies that you know about or have studied in other classes attempted to answer these questions?

	- what should be made? (allocation (of resources) problem)  
	- how should it be made? (production problem)  
	- for whom should it be made? (distribution problem)
