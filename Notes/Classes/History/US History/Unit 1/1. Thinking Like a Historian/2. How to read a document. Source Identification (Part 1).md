- Overall a bad time

- Speech
	- Acknowledges that things are bad
	- You have not been told the truth, now it's time to deal with how bad things have gotten
	- No need to be afraid of everything with malaise
	- Up until then, Herbert Hoover didn't do much and didn't think the government should fix
	- "There's nothing to fear but fear itself"
		- No time to panic, only thing we should be afraid of is running around like headless chickens.
