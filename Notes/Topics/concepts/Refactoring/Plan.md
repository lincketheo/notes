# Phase 1 (1 hour) - Major Code breaks (that can't work in a git workflow)
1. Get together and pair code major code changes that can't simply be PR'd due to merge conflicts:
    - Reformat code
    - Reorganize modules
    - Re write the structure of executables (e.g. a single testing main? a single post process main?)
    - ... and more
(All PR's should be merged from phase 1)

# Phase 2 (continuous) - Agile Refactoring
1. Weekly backlog grooming, Sprint planning, Retro, Daily Standups?
    - (Note: I (Theo) would suggest a 15-30 minute weekly backlog grooming, and maybe retro meeting, nothing else. This seems like a lightweight project, just have to be proactive about writing tickets)
2. **Code reviews**
    - For every ticket, there is one PR, which takes 1 code review
    - During phase 1 and 2, we can refactor the base code review checklist I wrote up with common patterns we've found, I've listed some in my notes here - but this is just a start
    - During code reviews, if something new comes up, add it to the checklist (to speed up future reviews)
