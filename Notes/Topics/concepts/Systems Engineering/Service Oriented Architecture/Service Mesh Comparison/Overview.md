# ISTIO *
    - Built on Envoy 
    - IBM + Google
    - Lyft donated envoy to cloud native computing foundation
    - ISTIO Has the most time to improve feature set
    - Features:
        - Load balancing
        - Traffic Routing
        - Policy Creation
        - Metrics
        - Service to Service Authentication
        - Attributes   
            - Specific data values relevant to service behavior
            - _Useful for this objective_
        - Monitoring Dashboard
    - Two components:
        - Data plane
            - Traffic management
            - Envoy: sidecar proxy routes traffic and calls between services
        - Control Plane
            - Developers can configure routing and view metrics
# Linkerd
    - Ultralight security first service mesh for kubernetes
    - Easy to set up
    - Rust proxy: linkerd2-proxy (built for linkerd)
    - Community driven - since 2016
# Consul Connect *
    - (HashiCorp)
    - Routing and segmentation
    - Service to service networking - application level sidecar proxy
    - Application security - proxies offer mTLS
    - Two proxy options
        - Built in layer proxy for testing
        - Supports Envoy
    - Emphasizes:
        - Opservability
    - Options for registering services (useful for this objective)
        - Orchestrator
        - Configuration files
        - API
        - Command line interface
# Kuma
    - Usable service mesh alternative
    - Platform agnostic control plane built on Envoy
    - Supports kubernetes and VMs
    - Can operate multiple meshes from a single control plane
        - useful for high security that require segmentation and centralized control
    - Easy - bundled with polocies
# Maesh *
    - Lightweight and straightforward
    - Traefik instead of Envoy (open source)
    - No side car:
        - Proxy endpoints for each node
        - Non invasive - doesn't edit kubernetes objects
    - Configurations:
        - Annotations on user service objects
        - Service Mesh Interface objects
        - SMI = _good_
# Service Comb Mesher
    - High performance service mesh in Go
    - Uses Go Chassis (go microservices framework)
        - Service discovery
        - load balancing
        - fault tolerance
        - route management
        - distributed tracing
    - Sidecar design:
        - Mesher sidecar proxy
    - Portable to docker kubernetes vms and bare metal
# Network Service Mesh
    - Built for telcos and ISPs
    - Layer for low level networking in Kubernetes
    - L2/L3 use cases
    - "exotic" protocols hetereogeneous network configurations
    - Use cases
        - Edge Computing
        - 5G
        - IoT devices
# AWS App Mesh
    - Application level networking for all services
    - Envoy
    - Good for people using AWS already - services include App Mesh with no extra charge:
        - Fargate
        - ECS
        - EKS
        - EC2
        - Kubernetes on EC2
    - Good monitoring tools
    - Cons: single vendors paradigm
# OpenShift Red Hat
    - Hybrid cloud enterprise Kubernetes platform
    - Builds on top of ISTIO
        - enhancements:
            - Tracing and Visibility (Jaeger)
    - Kiali - added observability into configuration traffic monitoring and tracing analysis
