# TLS / mTLS

## TLS
Verifies _only_ the server's identity

### One way TLS Goals:
1. Ensure that people don't visit spoofed websites
2. Keep data "over the wire" encrypted
3. Make sure data isn't altered over transit

## mTLS
### Challenges:
1. Distributing certificates to all end users is difficult
2. Zero trust
