Spring vs express - writing everything from scratch in express lets you print / console anywhere on the stack, but when you're restricted by the third party's abstraction, it's sometimes hard to observe (perfectly reasonable things)

Example: 
	Kotlin serialization, hard to print exactly what the wire sent - and it's not a bug in serialization - it's just a miscommunication between the two frameworks:w
