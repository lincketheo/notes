1. "Throughout history"
	- Makes an assumption about human nature
	- The way that people think now is how people have always thought
	- Core Concept: People are different over time - people in the past had different ideas / beliefs
	- Instead: Be specific about the time and place you're writing about
		- "In the postwar era"
		- "In the late 20th century"
		- "In the united states"
1. "It was inevitable"
	- Inevitable = unavoidable
	- If everything was unavoidable, interpretation is that people's choices don't matter
	- Instead: Emphasize how much choices matter
	- Some things are inevitable (natural disasters etc.) but history can be controlled
		- Example: USS Maine sinking - exploded in havana harbor
		- US Chose to believe that the sinking was a result of a spanish bomb
1. "And that's why \<\<country\>\> is so great today"
	- Avoid patriotism - use very sparingly
	- Define your terms - as best you can

Be specific
Emphasize choices and how events could have been different.
End with a conclusion that is very related to the information you addressed (don't introduce new information in your conclusion)
