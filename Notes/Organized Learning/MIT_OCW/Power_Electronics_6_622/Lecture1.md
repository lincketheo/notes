# Power Electronics
- Processing and control of electrical energy
- Example - Iphone5 Motherboard
    - WIFI 3.3 V
    - Flash 3.0 V
    - RF Modules 2.5-5.5 V
    - MEMS sensors 2.4 - 3.6 V
    - CPU, Display, Camera etc
- Industries:
    - Portable electronics (phone, ipad etc)
    - Computers / Telecommunications (Servers, Desktops etc)
    - Communications / RF (RF Amplifier etc)
    - Commercial Applications (Florescent lighting, LED Driver, etc)
    - Appliances (Air conditioner, Dishwasher)
    - Medical Applications 
    - Scientific Applications
    - Transportation (Inverters and motors) (Trains, future trains)
    - Powergeneration and transmission
    - HF / VHF Power
    - Industrial (DC Arc Furnace)
- Needs / Goals:
    - Miniaturization
    - Higher Efficiency
    - Higher Performance
        - Bandwidth / operating range
    - New Applications
- Example:
    - 9-16 V Input needs 5.5 V output
        - Solution 1:
            - Use a variable resistor / voltage divider:
                - + -> resistor -> vout -> resistor -> -
            - Highly inefficient (dissipates electrical power)
            - Power in = Vin * Iin
            - Power out = Vout * Iout
            - I stays the same, power out < power in
        - Solution 2:
            - PWM - pulse width modulation:
            - Control average voltage by fraction switch is on / off
            - Add a lowpass filter at the end to get the average (inductor and optionally capacitor - LC)
            - Efficiency can ideally be 100% (LC - Inductors and Capacitors are energy storage devices)
                - Doesn't loose power - you "store energy and release it when you want - don't just throw it away)


## Notes:
- Low Pass Filter:
    - High frequencies go away (gain is higher for low frequencies) - theoretically a square
- High Pass Filter:
    - Low frequencies go away
- LC filter:
