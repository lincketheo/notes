Who owns what
How does an economy decide what to produce
Who gets the output of that production

- Command Economy
	- e.g. Communist States
	- Government controls the factors of production
		- Factories 
			- "You have to produce 10,000 cars"
			- Who get's these cars? Not based on who is willing to pay / who can pay the most - lots of planning inside the government
		- Farms
	- Motivation:
		- Fairness / Equality
	- Cons:
		- Utopian
		- People still have access to things:
			- More access to leadership
			- More resources
- Market Economy
	- e.g. United States (most economies)
	- Factory independent of the government asks what the market needs
		- Factory sees how well cars were sold and adjusts
	- Cons:
		- Unequal
			- Some people get unlucky
			- Some people work harder
	- Motivations
		- Strong incentives for people to work
		- Innovations - no one rewards you if you make a better car in a communist economy - but you must innovate to compete 
- In between (Mixed Economy):
	- United States - still has regulations / public ownership
	- Most of the world falls here


## Observations
- Small scale decisions are easier to make than large scale ones - a factory has the most knowledgable people to make decisions about their industry
- People may also think they understand but experience is what matters the most
- Time:
	- If a command economy had infinite time and infinite effort, then it might make the same decisions as a market economy but market economy "lives in the situation"
	- You can't make everything up logically
- Large companies
	- People figure out over time that they're bad
	- Google Apple, people are noticing the downsides of a monolithic technology - they __are__ going away because of the motivations of individuals
		- Problem was that people's individual decisions take a while to proliferate
