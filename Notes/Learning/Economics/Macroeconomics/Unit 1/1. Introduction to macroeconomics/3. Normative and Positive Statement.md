Normative
- Matter of Opinion/Ethics

Positive
- Can be tested
- Doesn't have to be true

Examples:
1. Paying people who aren't working, even though they could work, is wrong and unfair
	- Normative ("Wrong/unfair")
2. Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work
	- Positive (Can be tested - e.g. introduce a welfare program on a small scale, survey them etc.)
3. Raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for government programs grow the economy
	- Positive (Can be tested - try it in a simulation for example)
4. Raising taxes on the wealthy slows economic growth
	- Positive (As long as "slow economic growth" has some metric)
5. The government should raise taxes for the wealthy to pay for helping the poor
	- Normative ("Should", can't be tested, do you believe ethically that this is true)

## Observations
Positive requires some sort of metric
