- Slow down your learning, give you space to think creatively - not everything needs to be rigorous
- Offer a space to learn - doesn't always need to be rigorous, time to think / reflect
- Make education just as if not more friendly as mind numbing content (social media)
- Immerse yourself in learning - swim in it

- Studying history disconnects you from present constraints - social media / masses influence on you
