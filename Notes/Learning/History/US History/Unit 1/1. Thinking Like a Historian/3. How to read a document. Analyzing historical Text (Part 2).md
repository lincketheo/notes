**Step 3:** Identify how an argument is made
- Look at rhetorical strategies and see how they're effect / not effective

FDR Speech
- Things are bad, but could be worse
- Not that people didn't have food, they didn't have money
- Used a lot of biblical stuff
	- Authoritative
	- Harness the authority 
- Specific people's fault
	- Blaming bankers for the great depression
- Buying stocks on margin
- The nation asks for action and action now

**Step 4**: Analyze the potential bias of a source
- (All sources are biased)

FDR Speech:
- What is motivating FDR to make the argument that he does
- Bias to his own administration's ideas
- Democrat (not many democrats since before Lincoln) - rejecting Hoover 
- Trying to make a case to the rest of the US who didn't elect him
- Government intervention:
	- Direct recruiting from the government itself
	- Strong case for federalism
- Lots that he doesn't say
	- How any of this will work (states it as is)
	- No specifics - more inspiration

**Step 5**: Synthesize as a tool for your own argument

FDR Speech
- Not a good speech for specifics / republican view point etc.
