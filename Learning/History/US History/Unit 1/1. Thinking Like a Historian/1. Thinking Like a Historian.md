1. Storytelling
	- In a good story, nothing just happens
	- Things have cause and effect
		- "And then WWII happened"
			- Has no reflection of why / what caused WWII
2. Scientific
	- Research _what_ happened in the past
	- Theorize what caused events in the past and test that theory with evidence
		- Lots of reading
3. Lawyer
	- Historians are always making an argument
		- Here's my idea, let me support it with evidence from witnesses etc.
		- Believe my theory / evidence
