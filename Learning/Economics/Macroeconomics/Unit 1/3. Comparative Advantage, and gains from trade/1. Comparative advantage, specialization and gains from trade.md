Charlie: OC => 1 plate = 3 cups
Patty: OC => 1 plate = 1/3 cups

Patty has a **comparative advantage in plates** because oc for plates is smaller

Charlie has a **Comparative advantage in cups** because oc for cups is smaller

If each specialize, they get to produce more

Trade 1 cup for 1 plate, before, charlie could make 1 plate for 1/3 cup - so this is a good deal
