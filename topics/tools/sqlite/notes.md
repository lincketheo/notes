# ACID:
- Guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures / other mishaps
- Transaction:
    - A series of operations that satisfy ACID properties
- Atomicity:
    - Each transaction is treated as a single unit
        - either succeeds or fails completely
- Consistency:
    - A transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another
    - Preserve database invariants:
- Isolation:
    - Concurrent execution of transactions leaves the db in the same state than if sequentially
- Durability:
    - Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even if system failure
