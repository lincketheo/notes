# Passband
- Describes the range of frequencies that can pass through a bandpass filter without being attenuated

# Bandpass
- Describes a filtering process
- Bandpass filter:
    - Passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects / attenuates frequencies outside that range

# Voltage Controlled Oscillator
- Outputs a frequency that is directly proportional to input voltage (DC)

# Attenuation
- Reduce the amplitude of a signal

# Changing the frequency
## Local Oscillator
- Used with a mixer to change the frequency of a signal

### Heterodyning
- Frequency changing process
$$cos(t1)cos(t2) = 1/2 cos(t1 - t2) + 1/2 cos(t1 + t2)$$
- Two frequencies $f1$ and $f2$ are mixed creating two new signals:
    - $f1 - f2$
    - $f1 + f2$
