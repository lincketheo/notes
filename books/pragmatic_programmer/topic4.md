# Stone soup and boiled frogs

Three soldiers returning home from war were hungry. When they saw a village, their spirits lifted, thinking the villagers would give them a meal. When they got there, the doors were locked and the windows were closed. Villagers were short of food and hoarded what they had.
Soldiers boiled a pot of water and placed three stones into it. The villagers came out to watch. 
"This is stone soup," the soldiers explained. "Is that all you put in it?" asked the villagers. "Absolutely—although some say it tastes even better with a few carrots…" A villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard.
A couple of minutes later, again a villager asked, “Is that it?”
Soldiers said — “Well, some couple of potatoes can further enhance the taste.” Again a villager rushed to return with some potatoes, to be added to the soup.
Over the next couple of hours, soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup, which makes different villagers ran off returning with an ingredient.
At last soldiers removed the stones from the soup, and they sat down with the villagers to enjoy the steamy soup.
