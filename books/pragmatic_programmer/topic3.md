Software Entropy

- Study about broken / worn down buildings.
    - Catalyst is a single broken window that went unrepaired 
    - One thing breaks - gives the mindset the entire code base is hopeless
    - Don't have broken windows
- Firefighters saving a burning tapestry in a rich house 
    - They lay a protector over the pristine carpet
    - Why not just put the fire out?
        - Recognized the risks, could prevent damages to the rest of the house before fixing the tapestry
- Entropy
    - Things tend towards disorder
    - Technical debt 
        - implies someone will pay it off eventually
    - Technical rot
        - sometimes more fitting - things fall apart and likely won't be repaired
