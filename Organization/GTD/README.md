## In
Quick things that need to be done - no processing. This "In" list can be in multiple places. Also in your notebook.
- Process one by one _in order_
- Is it actionable?
    - No: Someday / Maybe or throw it away
    - Yes: Physical and visible action
        - Bad: "plan cake lottery"
        - Good: "Email the guys about what cakes they want"
- If it takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it
## Next Actions
List of your next actions - do "as soon as possible"
## Projects
Any objective that requires more than one action to complete
- A list of project titles
- Descriptions
- Intended outcomes
There should always be at least one item in actions list for each project
## Someday Maybe
Things that you don't want to do right now but might want to do in the future
Examples
- Start a cult
- Replace old picture on wall
## Waiting For
Blocked actions. Add a date to each one of these items
## Weekly Review
1. Make sure each project has at least one action
2. Make sure that each action in next actions is actually something you need to do. If not, remove it or move to someday maybe
3. Look through someday maybe and see if something should move to next actions or projects
