8am Organized my system a bit
	- Moved all files to `Notes` and `Projects`
	- Wrote a README
	- Decided to duplicate work between work and life
	- Moved all GTD stuff to one README
Feeling sick still - been sick for 2 or 3 days? Maybe this has to do with not being clean? Yesterday my body ached a lot. Today, my throat hurts, not feeling as many aches.
	Yesterday: Achy, brain fog, some nausea - not sure if that's just food related
	Today (8am): throat hurt, some mild congestion
