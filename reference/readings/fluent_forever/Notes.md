# Introduction

The three keys of language learning:

1. Learn Pronunciation First
2. Don't translate
3. Use spaced repetition

Do this now

1. Choose your language
2. Language Books (no englishy words):

-   A good grammar book
-   A phrase book

## Key Points

1. Core Philosophy
    - Language learning fails because they rely on rote memorization

    - Focus on creating strong memories (by tricking your mind) using:
        - Associations
        - Visuals
        - Context
2. Practicality
    - Studying on the bus
3. Language Plateaus
    - Diminishing Returns
    - Over reliance on familiar resources
    - Lack of engagement
    - Insufficient immersion

# Chapter 2 - Five Principles

1. Make memories more memorable

2. Maximize Laziness

-   Study a concept until you can recall it once without assistance then move on

3. Don't review, recall
4. Wait Wait don't tell me

-   Intervals between study sessions to leverage spacing
-   Test yourself right before you forget

5. Rewrite the past

-   Every time you recall a memory, you modify it slightly
-   Connecting sounds experiences images and personal connections to every word you learn

## Combining the five principles

-   As deep and multisensory as possible
-   Study as little as possible
-   Practice recall
-   Challenging but not too hard
-   When we do forget, want immediate feedback to get on track
