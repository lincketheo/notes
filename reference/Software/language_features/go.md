# Why Go?
- (A) Efficient Compilation
- (B) Ease of Programming
- (C) Efficient Execution   

# Categories
- (A)/(C)
    - Java
        - Large environment and package structure
- (A)/(B)
    - Python
        - Very slow
- (C)
    - C/C++
        - Hard to compile and work with
- (A)/(B)/(C)
    - Go
        - (Or at least the motivation)

# Guiding Principles
- Simplicity as a core value
    - Simple syntax
    - Few keywords
    - As few ways to do one thing as possible
    - Language might not evolve as fast
- Commitement to backward compatibility
- Made for concurrent / network enabled applications
- Holistic approach to solving common problems
    - One go toolchain = all go tools

# Language Charateristics
- Strong static type system
- C inspired syntax
- Garbage Collection
- Fully Compiled 
- Single Binary Output
- Cross Platform

# Primary Use Cases
- Cloud and Network Services 
- Command Line Interfaces
- Cloud Infrastructure
    - Docker
    - K8s 
    - Terraform

# Evolution
## Original
C
-> C++
    - Introduction of classes
    - Lots of stuff / complicated 
-> Java
    - Simplify C++ language and reduce syntax
-> C#/JavaScript/...
    - Fixes other things / features

## New
C 
-> Go
    - What would C look like if we created it today?
        - Faster computers
        - Multiple CPUs 
        - Network Aware
    - Not trying to be C++ or Java
