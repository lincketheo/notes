# Java EE 

Java Enterprise Edition
A collection of specifications for developing and deploying enterprise applications
Enterprise Applications:
- Software hosted on servers that provide applications that support enterprise 

## 13 Core:

1. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
A standard API for connecting and executing queries on relational databases from Java applications, enabling seamless database access and manipulation.

2. **JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)**  
Provides an API for accessing naming and directory services, such as LDAP or DNS, allowing Java applications to look up and bind objects in a network or local environment.

3. **EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans)**  
A server-side component architecture for modular enterprise applications, offering services like transaction management, security, and scalability.

4. **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**  
A Java API that enables remote communication between objects in different JVMs, allowing methods to be called on remote objects as if they were local.

5. **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**  
A technology for creating dynamic web content by embedding Java code within HTML pages, facilitating server-side processing of web requests.

6. **Java Servlets**  
Server-side Java components that process client requests and generate responses, typically used for web applications.

7. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**  
A flexible, text-based format for storing and transporting structured data, commonly used in Java for data interchange and configuration.

8. **JMS (Java Message Service)**  
An API for message-oriented middleware, enabling communication between distributed applications via messaging systems like queues and topics.

9. **Java IDL (Interface Definition Language)**  
Supports building CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) applications in Java, facilitating communication between objects in a heterogeneous environment.

10. **JTS (Java Transaction Service)**  
Provides transaction management services based on the CORBA OTS (Object Transaction Service) model, ensuring distributed transactions are processed reliably.

11. **JTA (Java Transaction API)**  
A high-level API for managing distributed transactions, allowing developers to coordinate multiple resource managers like databases and messaging systems.

12. **JavaMail**  
An API for sending, receiving, and managing electronic mail, supporting protocols like SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.

13. **JAF (JavaBeans Activation Framework)**  
Simplifies handling and processing of data streams in various MIME types, often used alongside JavaMail for email attachments and content.
