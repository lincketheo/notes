- Just the facts
    - A website with simple google search result with 1 answer per question
    - Uses fancy search capabilities to _find the right question that's being asked_
        - but there's a 1:1 relationship between question and answer. 
        - Community collaborates on answers?
    - Start out simple  
        - What is the difference between a roth ira and a 401k?
            - Just lists the facts 
    - No ambiguous questions allowed. No context, no conclusions no opinions
